# üèóÔ∏è New York City Airbnb Recommendation System  

## üìú Overview  
This project develops a **content-based recommendation system** for **New York City Airbnb listings**, utilizing **Airbnb Open Data, customer reviews, and NYC subway station locations**. The system helps users find the most suitable Airbnb listings based on their preferences for **neighborhood, price point, and review rating**. The recommendation includes the nearest subway station and distance for convenience.  

## üéØ Problem Explanation  

### **Datasets Used**  
The project incorporates three datasets:  
1. **NYC Airbnb Listings** (42,931 observations) ‚Äì Airbnb listing details such as location, price, and availability.  
2. **NYC Airbnb Reviews** (1,110,024 observations) ‚Äì Customer reviews for sentiment analysis.  
3. **NYC Subway Stations** (473 observations) ‚Äì Subway locations for accessibility recommendations.  

The goal is to preprocess these datasets, extract meaningful features, and **build a recommendation system**.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details  

### **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Histograms, scatterplots, and geospatial maps used to visualize distributions and relationships between features.  
  - Identification of high-priced listings and popular Airbnb neighborhoods.  
  - Outlier detection and removal.  

- **Sentiment Analysis for Review Scores**  
  - Applied **RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach)**, a **pre-trained NLP model**, to analyze review sentiment.  
  - Generated **compound sentiment scores** (scaled **1 to 5**) for use in recommendations.  

- **Clustering Airbnb Listing Names**  
  - Used **TF-IDF** and **K-Means clustering** to group listings based on descriptive text.  
  - Determined **9 optimal clusters** via the **Elbow method**.  

- **Calculating Nearest Subway Station**  
  - Used **Geopy‚Äôs geodesic distance function** to compute distances between each Airbnb and its nearest subway station.  
  - Stored **nearest subway station name and distance (in miles)** as features.  

### **2. Recommendation System Development**  
- **Content-Based Filtering Approach**  
  - Users provide **three preferences**:  
    1. **Neighborhood Group** (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn)  
    2. **Maximum Price**  
    3. **Minimum Review Rating**  
  - Filters Airbnb listings based on user inputs.  
  - Uses **Cosine Similarity** to compare user preferences with listing features.  
  - Returns **top five most relevant listings** along with:  
    - Listing Name  
    - Neighborhood  
    - Review Score  
    - Nearest Subway Station & Distance  

### **3. Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Explored Review Score Effectiveness**  
  - Compared **RoBERTa-generated sentiment scores** against raw reviews.  
- **Evaluated K-Means Clustering Performance**  
  - Used **Elbow method** to select the best number of clusters.  
- **Validated Recommendation Quality**  
  - Ensured recommendations align with user preferences.  

## üöÄ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (for data processing and modeling).  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data handling and transformation).  
- **Scikit-learn** (for TF-IDF, K-Means clustering, and similarity computation).  
- **NLTK & Transformers (Hugging Face)** (for NLP-based review sentiment analysis).  
- **Geopy** (for distance calculations).  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization).
